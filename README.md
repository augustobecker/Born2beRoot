<h2 align="center" id="what-is-born2beroot" > What is Born2beRoot?</h2>
The forth project at 42. It consists of having you set up your first server by following specific rules, develop a sricpt to display important system informations and turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your repository (You must paste in it the signature of your machine‚Äôs virtual disk).

<h3 align="center" id="the-rules">:bookmark_tabs: The Rules: </h3>

:small_blue_diamond: Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM.

:small_blue_diamond: The hostname of the virtual machine must be acesar-l42 and I have to modify this hostname during a peer-evaluation.

:small_blue_diamond: In addition to the root user, a user with your acesar-l as username has to be present, and this user has to belong to the user42 and sudo groups.

:small_blue_diamond: Implement a strong password policy, that consists of:

	The password has to expire every 30 days.
	
	The minimum number of days allowed before the modification of a password will be set to 2.
	
	The user has to receive a warning message 7 days before their password expires.
	
	The password must be at least 10 characters long. It must contain an uppercase letter and a number.
	Also, it must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters.
	
	The password must not include the name of the user.
	
	The following rule does not apply to the root password: The password must have at least 7 characters
	that are not part of the former password.
	
	 Of course, your root password has to comply with this policy.
	
:small_blue_diamond: Install and configure sudo following strict rules.

	Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incorrect password.
	
	A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong 
	password occurs when using sudo.
	
	Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file
	has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder.
	
	The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons.

	For security reasons too, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
